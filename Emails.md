Hi <name>,

I'm <Linan|Kenneth>, one of the monkeys behind <openlectures|openquestions|opennotes>. Thank you for joining us! I hope <openlectures|openquestions|opennotes> has been useful for you.

We created <openlectures|openquestions|opennotes> to make learning easy and simple for you. Sometimes we're confused, sometimes we're in a bad spot, and sometimes we just get lousy teachers. School's already hard enough, and we'd like to make sure it doesn't get any harder.

If there's anything we can help with - a question, a problem, or your feedback - please feel free to reply to this email and let me know. We'd love to make your experience at <openlectures|openquestions|opennotes> even better.

Happy Mugging!
